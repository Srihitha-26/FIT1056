A Python variable is a named container for data. You can store values like numbers, text, or more complex data 
types in variables. Variables are created by using the assignment operator =. 

For example:
my_variable = 42

Here, my_variable holds the integer value 42. Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to specify the data 
type explicitly. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but can't start with a number. 
They are case-sensitive.
